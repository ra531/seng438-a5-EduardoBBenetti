# Introduction



# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart



# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
There were mainly two obstacles through out the development of the lab assignment. Firstly, the incompatibility with some machines made it hard to have all group members working on separate tasks at the same time. To tackle that issue, we divided the team into two pairs to work more efficiently, while one group member analyzed the data, the other inputted the information into the required applications to be correctly processed. Even having this division, all group members participated actively on the discussions about the routes that the team should take and ways to work more efficiently. The second biggest challenge was to setup the softwares and given data into the machines. Instructions were not very clear and detailed for us, since we didnot have any background on how to use them, so it took some time for us to get used to the software and its functionalities.


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab was interesting to get a practical sense of software test reliability, moving away from slides and actually runnning test helps a lot to throughly understand the content. However, it would be better to use more modern and recently developed tools rather than the ones used for this assignment. The incompatibility with different OSs and other version-related problems should be fized by using more recent applications. Additionally, that process costed a lot of time to work on the assignment since we could not have everyone working separately on different parts of the assignment. Lastly, please add more detailed instructions to use the tools. Since is was something new for all students, the learning curve is very steep and time consuming. I believe having videos and proper documentation can help future students have a insightfull and efficient learning process.
