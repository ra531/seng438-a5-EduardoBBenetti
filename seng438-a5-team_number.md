This lab was interesting to get a practical sense of software test reliability, moving away from slides and actually runnning test helps a lot to throughly understand the content. However, it would be better to use more modern and recently developed tools rather than the ones used for this assignment. The incompatibility with different OSs and other version-related problems should be fized by using more recent applications. Additionally, that process costed a lot of time to work on the assignment since we could not have everyone working separately on different parts of the assignment. Lastly, please add more detailed instructions to use the tools. Since is was something new for all students, the learning curve is very steep and time consuming. I believe having videos and proper documentation can help future students have a insightfull and efficient learning process.
